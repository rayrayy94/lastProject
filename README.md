# lastProject

This project was about creating a program that helps a grocery store count how many times each item was bought during the day. The store gives a file with all the items listed, and my program reads that file, counts the items, and shows how many times each item was bought. It also lets the user search for a specific item, see a list of all items and their counts, or view a simple chart made of stars that shows how popular each item is. I think I did a good job making the menu simple and the output easy to read. If I were to improve anything, I would add input checks so users don't type something wrong by mistake. The part I found hardest was learning how to work with maps and how to read and write to files, but I looked up examples and asked for help when I needed it. This project taught me skills that I know Iâ€™ll use in other classes, especially reading files, using loops, and organizing code. I also tried to keep my code clean and easy to understand by naming things clearly and adding comments.
